        <p style = "margin-top: 0px;"> The schooling behavior you see is based off 
          of Craig Reynolds' model. The three sliders you
          see represent the different behavioral abilities of
          each fish in a school. The separation slider controls
          the distance that the fish will want to keep from one another.
          The alignment slider controls how much the fish will want to 
          swim in the same direction. The cohesion slider controls how
          much a fish wants to stay close to the school.
        </p>
        <p>When a fish flashes white, it means that it's scared. The scare slider
          controls how comfortable the fish feel around a shark.
        </p>
        <p>Play around witht these sliders and see what types of school 
          behaviors you can create!
