        <p style = "margin-top: 0px;"> The schooling behavior you see is based off 
          of Craig Reynolds' boid flocking model. In his model, each creature has
          three behaviors, separation (don't bump into your neighbors), alignment (go in the same direction
          as your neighbors), and cohesion (stay with your neighbors). The three sliders you
          see control the magnitude of these forces. The "neighborhood" slider controls how large of a neighborhood
          each fish has. So if your neighborhood is small it means you are only going to align and cohere to
          other fish that are only really close to you. While if the neighborhood is large, you will also align and cohere with
          fish that are farther away. 
        </p>
        <p>When a fish flashes white, it means that it's scared. The skittishness slider
          controls how comfortable the fish feel around a shark.
        </p>
        <p>Play around with these sliders and see what types of school 
          behaviors you can create!
