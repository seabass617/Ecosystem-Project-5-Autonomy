# Ecosystem Project 5: Autonomy

Fifth project as I make my way through "The Nature of Code". This project is a huge milestone in that we are now modeling behaviors through a vehicle's desire. A fish is actually getting scared and feels the desire to turn away from the shark vs. the shark detecting whether or not a fish is within it's radius and imparting a force to it. In the real world, does a shark make a fish swim away via some form of emotional telepathic manipulation? Or is it that the fish is afraid of a shark and wants to swim away? I think the latter is more accurate. 

Steps: 
- Convert all fish to be autonomous vehicles
- Apply schooling behavior
- Apply fear of shark behavior
- Optimize algorithm
